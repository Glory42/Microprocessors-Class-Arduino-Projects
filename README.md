# Microprocessors Lab Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Microprocessors class! Here, you'll find my lab work, which includes various Arduino projects designed to explore and demonstrate microprocessor concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of microprocessor functionality and programming.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects completed as part of my Microprocessors class. Each project illustrates practical applications of microprocessor theory and provides hands-on experience with hardware and software development using Arduino.

## Projects

### 1. Traffic Light Simulation with Pedestrian Crossing Button
- **Description**: Simulates a traffic light system with a pedestrian crossing feature.
- **Key Features**:
  - Red, yellow, and green LED lights with a standard sequence.
  - Pedestrian button for crossing that triggers a blinking red light.
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino board
  - LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
  - Resistors
  - Push button
  - Breadboard and jumper wires

### 2. Ambient Light-Controlled Distance Sensor Display
- **Description**: A proximity-based ambient display system that changes LED color based on object distance, with a button for alert mode.
- **Key Features**:
  - Changes LED color based on detected distance:
    - Blue for far (50+ cm)
    - Green for medium (20-50 cm)
    - Red for close (under 20 cm)
  - Alert mode activated by button press, blinking red LED when an object is within 20 cm.
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino Uno (or compatible model)
  - RGB LED
  - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
  - Button
  - 220-ohm resistors
  - Breadboard and jumper wires

*(More projects to be added)*

## Technologies Used
