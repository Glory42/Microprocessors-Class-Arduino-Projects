# Traffic-Light-Simulation-with-Pedestrian-Crossing-Button
This project demonstrates a basic traffic light system designed using the Arduino platform. The system operates with three LED lights (red, yellow, green) that simulate a standard traffic light sequence, with an additional feature for pedestrian crossing.
