# Microprocessors Lab Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Microprocessors class! Here, you'll find my lab work, which includes various Arduino projects designed to explore and demonstrate microprocessor concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of microprocessor functionality and programming.

Special thanks to [osnn96](https://github.com/osnn96) for their contributions!

## Projects

### 1. Traffic Light Simulation with Pedestrian Crossing Button
- **Description**: Simulates a traffic light system with a pedestrian crossing feature.
- **Key Features**:
  - Red, yellow, and green LED lights with a standard sequence.
  - Pedestrian button for crossing that triggers a blinking red light.
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino board
  - LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
  - Resistors
  - Push button
  - Breadboard and jumper wires

### 2. Ambient Light-Controlled Distance Sensor Display
- **Description**: A proximity-based ambient display system that changes LED color based on object distance, with a button for alert mode.
- **Key Features**:
  - Changes LED color based on detected distance:
    - Blue for far (50+ cm)
    - Green for medium (20-50 cm)
    - Red for close (under 20 cm)
  - Alert mode activated by button press, blinking red LED when an object is within 20 cm.
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino Uno (or compatible model)
  - RGB LED
  - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
  - Button
  - 220-ohm resistors
  - Breadboard and jumper wires

### 3. Plant Monitoring and Alert System 
- **Description**: Monitors plant conditions using sensors and sends updates via Telegram to ensure proper care.
- **Key Features**:
  - Measures temperature, humidity, light level, and soil moisture.
  - Sends real-time updates and alerts via Telegram.
  - Provides specific messages based on soil moisture levels.
- **Components Used**:
  - ESP32 (or similar WiFi-enabled Arduino board)
  - DHT11 Sensor
  - LDR Sensor
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
  - WiFi module
  - Breadboard and jumper wires
  - Resistors
